      <h2>Turkish Tantuni</h2>
      <p>
        Tantuni is a Turkish dish I, myself, taste very late but I loved it the moment I first taste it. Since then, I try to eat it whenever possible. It's commonly found in Turkey but city of Mersin is famous for its tantuni. Tantuni can be made with both white meat and red meat. Red meat is a heavier than white meat tantuni but both of them taste amazing.

        Tantuni is relatively easy to make. I prefer white meat tantuni as I find it tastier and good on stomach but red meat form is a must-eat. One can find it anywhere in Turkey but the best ones are always in Mersin. You can make it at home easily. Follow the steps below and taste another great Turkish food. Get ready!
