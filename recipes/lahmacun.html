      <h2>Is Lahmacun Really That Good?</h2>
      <p>
        Lahmacun is maybe one of the well-known Turkish foods ever. It's also my favorite dish and I love every single moment eating it. I love it since I was a little child and It seems I won't stop loving lahmacun. Lahmacun is not an easy to make dish but it's worth every second we spend cooking it. It can be found in entire Turkey but city of Gaziantep, which is my home city, famous for it's lahmacun making.

        Lahmacun is cooked with many variations but my favorite is lahmacun with garlic. But lahmacun with onion is also commonly found in Turkey. It can also be made at different sizes from little round ones to long kind of rectangle ones. Some people prefer it also with lemons. Lahmacun is also known as Turkish Pizza.
